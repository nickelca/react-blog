                    <p>Juan Eulogio, a compsci major at UW Madison in his senior year volunteered
                        his time to teach a group of students, me included, how to make a website!
                        We're using the JavaScript framework ReactJS, HTML, and CSS to make and style
                        our website. I've programmed for a while, but I had no clue how to do this until
                        he helped us get started! I've seen a bunch of nice websites made by the other
                        students in the class. I've had a blast doing this. 10/10 experience, would recommend.
